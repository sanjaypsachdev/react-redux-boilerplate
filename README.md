# Boilerplate for creating React-Redux based projects

This is a boilerplate for creating React-Redux based projects.

## Prerequisites

The project was built with Node.js version 11.14.0. Besides, we also need yarn v1.1.5.2 installed globally.

## Getting Started

In order to install the required dependencies, run the below command from the root directory :

  yarn install

In order to run, please execute the below command from the root directory, to be able to run it in development mode locally :

  yarn dev-server

In order to run the tests run the below command :

  yarn test --watch

In order to build a production artifact for deploying on the server, run the below command :

  yarn build

### Installing

In order to install the required dependencies, run the below command from the root directory :

yarn install

## Running the tests

In order to run the tests run the below command :

yarn test

## Deployment

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) - The web framework used
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - Dependency Management
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - The UI library used
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - The client side state container
* [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) - Router for the project
* [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - Backend no-sql datastore for persisting data
* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) - With a plain basic Redux store, you can only do simple synchronous updates by dispatching an action. Middleware extend the store's abilities, and let you write async logic that interacts with the store
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react) - Testing library for react
* [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) - Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output. You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Module bundler and dev server
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass for styling
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - JavaScript compiler
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Node.js web server to host the app
